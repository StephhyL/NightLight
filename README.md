GameApp is currently being developed.

GameApp is a web application that allow users to play nostalgic games such as minesweeper, flappybird, and space invasions.

GameApp is being built with React front-end, Express back-end, and PostgreSQL for its database. Styled with MaterialsUI and SASS.

GameApp was the second choice for my group's Lighthouse Lab bootcamp's final project. We ended up choosing to create Hodo (a collaborative whiteboard application) for our final project - go check it out (it's pinned on my profile). But GameApp is something that we wanted to pursue post-bootcamp because we think it would be something fun to make that has a bit of nostalgia to it.
